# ResQRelief-Project

ResQRelief is a machine learning project for disaster impact prediction and response management.  
The MVP starts with flood prediction, but the system is designed to extend to other disasters in the future.  

## Datasets
- `flood.csv` – flood-related data  
- `disaster_messages.csv` – disaster-related messages  
- `disaster_categories.csv` – categories linked to messages  
- `census.csv` – demographic and regional data  

## Week 1 Progress
- Imported required libraries  
- Loaded datasets into Colab  
- Performed initial checks: `.head()`, `.info()`, `.isnull().sum()`, `.describe()`
